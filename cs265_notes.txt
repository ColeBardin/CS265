	write non-trivial C programs
	effectively use pointers in C
	use C memory management
	use Make utility to manage build
	use debugger

many 'flavors' of UNIX


POSIX:
	IEEE Portable Operatix System based on Unix

SUS (Single Unix Specification):
	by the Open Group
	they certify unix distributions
	once certified, it can be called 'All Capital'
	MacOS is certified but Linux is not


Unix unix or UNIX

Unix:	family of OS that includes UNIX operating systems or UNIX like
UNIX operating systems:		OS that have been certifed (MacOS)
Unix-Like Operating systems:	OS that have not been certified (GNU, Linux)



OS Primary Features:
Abstraction:
	provides execution environment for program and use system resources through unified interface regardless of hardware

Isolation:
	execution of program doesn't interfere with execution of other programs, and they can occur concurrently

Security:
	applies security policy that controls coordinates access to system resources so programmers cannot break abstraction or isolation requirements



POSIX Compliance for command line arguments:
must include - or -- before argument and be separated with whitespace from command


non-option arguments are data passed to the command


`tar xvf file` is not POSIX compliant but it runs (tar is for take archive)

`tail -f -n30 error.log`
tail displays end of file
f (follow) updates when file is updated
n30 displays last 30 lines



Quotes:
ls a*t is different from ls 'a*t'

Double Quotes:
can protect special characters but $,\,`..` will still be interpreted


stat shows all metadeta of file
ls -ot displays all files in order of last modification time
