Q1: uninit.c creates both local and global float and int vars, but does not assign them a value. then it prints out the
values of the variables. I did not know what to expect since I had never played around with uninitialized variables, but
I assumed they would default to whatever happened to be stored there. With gcc, only the local int had a nonzero value,
but with tcc all values were initialized to 0. By my guess, it seems to be a feature of tcc to do that.

Q2: Done. file is bills.c

Q3: with i=5, j=3:
i+=j makes i=8 and j=3
i=j++ makes i=8 and j=4
i=++j makes i=9 and j=4
i%j does not alter the values stored in i nor j but returns 2
i%j++ does not alter the value of i, but it returns the value of 2 and then increments j to be 4

Q4: scanf will read from stdin (keyboard) until hitting EOF or whitespace or newline, then attempts to match it to the format
specifier given. getchar will also read from stdin stream, however it will only read one character from the stream
regardless of the format. Scanf moves the file position marker to the next whitespace while getchar will only move the
file position marker one character. Example, calling scanf with %c and entering a string longer than length 1 will only
save the first character into the given variable, but the rest of the string will be omitted. on the other hand, getchar
will would only read the first char of that string and allow the other characters to be accessed by calling getchar
again.

Q5: 
	double x = 12.300000
	integer i = 45, scanf ignores all floating point value
	double y = 0.600000
	since 45.6 is interpreted as int 45 and float .6 with no whitespace, disregarding 789 since it matched its 3 vars

Q6:
