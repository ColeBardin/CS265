Q1: uninit.c creates both local and global float and int vars, but does not assign them a value. then it prints out the
values of the variables. I did not know what to expect since I had never played around with uninitialized variables, but
I assumed they would default to whatever happened to be stored there. With gcc, only the local int had a nonzero value,
but with tcc all values were initialized to 0. By my guess, it seems to be a feature of tcc to do that.
