Q1: uninit.c creates both local and global float and int vars, but does not assign them a value. then it prints out the
values of the variables. I did not know what to expect since I had never played around with uninitialized variables, but
I assumed they would default to whatever happened to be stored there. With gcc, only the local int had a nonzero value,
but with tcc all values were initialized to 0. By my guess, it seems to be a feature of tcc to do that.

Q2: Done. file is bills.c

Q3: with i=5, j=3:
i+=j makes i=8 and j=3
i=j++ makes i=8 and j=4
i=++j makes i=9 and j=4
i%j does not alter the values stored in i nor j but returns 2
i%j++ does not alter the value of i, but it returns the value of 2 and then increments j to be 4
