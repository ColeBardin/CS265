Part 1: Structs:

1.1:
/* sec2hms function:
Given number of seconds since midnight, calculates the time of day
Expected to not get number of seconds that would overflow to next day
Retruns struct time object
Parameters:
	int secs: 	Number of seconds since midnight
*/
struct time sec2hms( int secs ){
	/* Create temporary struct time */
	struct time temp;
	/* Divide by 3600 to get number of hours */
	temp.hr = secs / 3600;
	/* Subtract hours from count */
	secs = secs % 3600;
	/* Divide by 60 to get number of minutes */
	temp.min = secs / 60;
	/* Subtract minutes from count, leaves number of seconds */
	temp.sec = secs % 60;
	/* Return the address of the struct */
	return temp;
}
